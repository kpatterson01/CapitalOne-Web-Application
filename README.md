# CapitalOne-Web-Application
Description: Build a web app that analyzes bike share data 

Summary: This web application was created for the Capital One 2019 Summit. The assignment was to create a web application that answers 
questions from bike sharing data. 
-I used Atom as my editor to create this website, and also the framework Bootstrap and Jquery to display cool effects on this website.
-One cool effect that I am really proud of is a the parallex effect as well as changing the cursor to a bike. 

Conclusion: I had a lot of fun creating this web application about bike sharing data and I hope you like my website.
